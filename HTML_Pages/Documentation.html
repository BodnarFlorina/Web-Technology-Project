                 <h3 id="project-subjec">2.1 Project Description</h3>
                 <p> Hema is a web-based manager designed to aid in organizing collections of graphic representations of 
                    pressed plants along with their related attributes.
                    This platform is suitable for botanists, herbalists, or nature enthusiasts who enjoy collecting and 
                    preserving plant specimens. Hema provides a convenient and user-friendly interface 
                    to manage your herbal collection. With Hema, it is easy to upload images of your pressed plants, 
                    add relevant information such as their scientific and common names, descriptions, locations,
                    and dates of collection, and keep track of their attributes, properties, and uses.

                 <h3 id="motivatio">2.2 Motivation</h3>
                 <p>
                    We chose this project for the subject Technological Web due to the fact that we are motivated to 
                    raise awareness about the importance of preserving plant life and creating a digital collection that can be accessed by people all over the world.
                    An online herbarium website can help promote public awareness and appreciation for plants and their role in the environment. 
                    By providing a visually engaging and informative platform, the website can help educate the general public about the importance of plant biodiversity, conservation, and sustainability.
                 </p>

                 <h3 id="user">2.3 Potential Users </h3>
                 <p>
                    Our online herbarium can be a valuable resource for a diverse range of users, from botany and biology students to researchers, professionals, environmentalists, conservationists, gardeners, landscapers, and the general public.
                    The online herbarium can also be a valuable resource for anyone, who can use it to learn about different plant species, their characteristics, and their importance for the environment.

            <h3 id="user-experience"> 3.1 User-Experience </h3>
                <p>
                We make an effort to create great experience for our users by choosing appropriate fonts and colors. We consider that  a positive UX can contribute to a website's credibility and reputation,
                as users are more likely to trust and recommend a site that provides a seamless and enjoyable experience. </p>

            <h4 id="colors" > 3.1.1 Colors </h4>
            <p>
                The chosen color palette for a website that is a herbarium  can have a significant impact on the user experience and the overall feel of the website.
                 The palette of colors chosen (606C38, 283618, FEFae0, DDA15E, BC6C25) 
                 incorporates various shades of green and brown, which are commonly associated with nature and plant life. 
                 This can help to create an inviting and organic feel to the website, which is appropriate for a herbarium.
                The use of light and muted colors (such as FEFae0) also helps to create a calming and soothing atmosphere, 
                 which can encourage users to spend more time exploring the site. Additionally, 
                  the contrast between the green and brown shades (606C38, 283618, DDA15E, BC6C25) can help 
                  to highlight important elements and create a visually appealing and cohesive design.
                   Overall, the chosen color palette is well-suited for a website that is a herbarium
                and can help to create a memorable and enjoyable user experience.
            </p>
          
            <h4 id="fonts" > 3.1.2 Fonts </h4>
            <p>
                The font choice for a website's pages can play a significant role in shaping the overall user experience and creating the desired aesthetic. 
                Regular Brush, that is used for the welcome page, is a handwritten font that features bold and flowing strokes, creating a unique and eye-catching appearance. 
                This font is often used for creative and informal designs, which can be suitable for a welcoming and friendly atmosphere on a website.
                Regular Brush's irregular and slightly imperfect style can add a human touch to the design, which can help to create a more personal connection with the users.
                Additionally, the font is highly legible, which is important for ensuring that the content on the welcome page is easily
                readable and accessible to all users. Also, "Simple Handmade", which is used for info text,
                is a font that has a handwritten and natural look, which can make it an appropriate choice for a website related to nature, such as a herbarium. 
                Serif fonts are used for headers because they can convey a sense of sophistication, elegance, and professionalism. The serif font has small lines or flourishes at the ends of each letter, which can make them easier to read and distinguish from other letters in the text.
